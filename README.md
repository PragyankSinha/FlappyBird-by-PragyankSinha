## Overview
This project is a beginner-friendly recreation of the popular *Flappy Bird* game using **Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)**.  

The project covers:  
• Setting up a new UE5 project.  
• Designing game assets and level layout.  
• Implementing character movement and physics.  
• Adding pipes, obstacles, and collision logic.  
• Creating scoring mechanics and UI.  
• Packaging the final game build for Windows and Android.

## Problem Statement
Flappy Bird is a simple yet addictive arcade game where the player must control a bird to navigate through a series of pipes without collision.  
The goal of this project is to replicate this gameplay in UE5 to understand:  
• Basics of Unreal Engine’s Blueprint system.  
• How to handle physics-based movement.  
• How to implement UI elements like score counters.  
• Game packaging and deployment.  

---

## Project Setup
• Installed **Unreal Engine 5** from Epic Games Launcher.  
• Created a new **Blank Blueprint Project**.  
• Configured project folders for assets, blueprints, and UI.  
• Set default map and game mode.
